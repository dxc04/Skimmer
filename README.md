Skimmer
=======

Skimmer is a file traversal tool

HELPING THIS CODE TO GROW IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.

Usage
-----

* cd public_html
* cd branch_name
* python path/to/skimmer init_repo
* python path/to/skimmer DnaAssessmentStudent.class.php

You can add the bin directory of Skimmer on your environment PATH so you can run the script wherever you are.

Current Limitations
------------------

* files need to be unique
* Needs more error handling
* Creates a file in the current base directory

Todo
----

* Error Handling
* Remove the init_repo command, automatically index the files on the current directory
* Select a File option for duplicate files
* Centrality feature!
* Integrate on VIM
* Find with regex
