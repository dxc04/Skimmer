# Author: Sandae P. Macalalag
# Application: Skimmer v0.1 in Python 2.4
# Build Date Friday May 14, 2010
# Last Modification Date: Sunday October 3, 2011

# USAGE:
#	cd public_html
#	cd branch_name
# 	python path/to/skimmer.py init_repo
#	//// This will index the files and directories on that branch

# 	python path/to/skimmer.py DnaAssessmentStudent.class.php
#       //// This will find the file and open it in vim

#	You can add the bin directory of Skimmer on your environment PATH so you can run the script wherever you are.

# CURRENT LIMITATION:
#       * files need to be unique
#       * Needs more error handling
#	* Creates a file in the current base directory

# TODO:
#       * Error Handling
#       * Remove the init_repo command, automatically index the files on the current directory
#	* Select a File option for duplicate files
#	* Centrality feature!
#	* Integrate on VIM
#	* Find with regex

#	HELPING THIS CODE TO GROW IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.
